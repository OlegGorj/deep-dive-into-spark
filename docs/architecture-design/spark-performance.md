## Overview

## Performance Improvements

## Performance Benchmark
HiBench features many benchmarks within it that exercise several components of Spark (great for stressing core, sql, MLlib capabilities), SparkSqlPerf features 99 TPC-DS queries (stressing the DataFrame API and therefore the Catalyst optimiser), both work well with Spark 2
